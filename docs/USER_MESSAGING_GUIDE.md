🔔 Value Alert: Saints +14.5 at FanDuel

Most books have Saints +13.5. FanDuel is giving you an extra
point of value. Line opened at +12.5 and has moved toward the Saints.

📊 Comparison:
• FanDuel: +14.5 ⭐ (Best)
• DraftKings: +13.5
• BetMGM: +13.5
• Caesars: +13

💡 Why it matters: Getting +14.5 instead of +13.5 could be the
difference between a push and a win if the Saints lose by exactly 14.

## Help & FAQ Content

### ✅ GOOD FAQ

**Q: Does your platform predict winners?**
A: No, we don't make predictions. We help you find value by comparing odds across 15+ sportsbooks, tracking line movement, and identifying sharp action. You make your own decisions based on the data we provide.

**Q: What is "sharp action"?**
A: Sharp action refers to betting activity from professional bettors. We detect this through:
• Reverse line movement (line moves opposite to public betting)
• Steam moves (multiple books moving lines quickly)
• Sharp book consensus (Pinnacle, CRIS agreeing on a line)

**Q: How do I use odds discrepancies?**
A: When we show a discrepancy like "Saints +14.5 at FanDuel vs +13.5 consensus," it means FanDuel is offering a better line. If you were going to bet Saints anyway, FanDuel gives you an extra point of value.

**Q: What does "best available line" mean?**
A: It's the most favorable odds you can get across all the sportsbooks we track. For example, if you want to bet the favorite, we'll show you which book has the smallest spread. If you want the underdog, we'll show the largest spread.

## In-App Tooltips

### ✅ GOOD Tooltips

**Line Movement**
> Track how the spread or total has changed from when the line first opened to the current number. Significant movement often indicates sharp action.

**Sharp Action**
> Professional bettors moving the line. Identified through reverse line movement (line moves opposite to public betting) or steam moves (rapid coordinated movement across multiple books).

**Odds Discrepancy**
> When different sportsbooks have different lines for the same game. The bigger the discrepancy, the more value opportunity exists.

**ATS Record**
> Against The Spread record. Shows how often a team has covered the spread in their recent games. A team can have a good win/loss record but poor ATS record.

### ❌ BAD Tooltips

**Win Probability**
> Our AI's calculated chance that a team will win the game, based on thousands of historical matchups and current conditions.

**Confidence Score**
> How confident our prediction model is in this outcome. 5 stars = very confident, 1 star = low confidence.
