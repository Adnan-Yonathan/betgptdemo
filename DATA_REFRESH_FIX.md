# Data Refresh Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem
Data was not being refreshed for 20 hours because the cron jobs were calling **non-existent edge functions**:
- `fetch-sports-scores` - Did not exist
- `fetch-betting-odds` - Did not exist (only partial implementation)

## Root Cause
The database migrations set up cron jobs to call these edge functions, but the functions themselves were never created. This caused silent failures where the cron jobs would run but do nothing.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Missing Edge Functions

#### `fetch-sports-scores`
**Location:** `supabase/functions/fetch-sports-scores/index.ts`

Fetches live scores and schedules from ESPN API for all major sports:
- NFL
- NCAAF (College Football)
- NBA
- MLB
- NHL
- WNBA
- MLS

**Features:**
- Fetches scores for all sports or specific sports
- Updates `sports_scores` table with latest data
- Free API with no rate limits
- Comprehensive error handling

#### `fetch-betting-odds`
**Location:** `supabase/functions/fetch-betting-odds/index.ts`

Fetches betting odds from The Odds API:
- Supports all major sports
- Fetches moneyline (h2h), spreads, and totals
- Updates `betting_odds` table
- Logs fetch history to `betting_odds_fetch_log`
- Tracks API quota usage

**Configuration Required:**
- `THE_RUNDOWN_API` environment variable must be set in backend secrets

### 2. Updated Cron Job Schedules

#### New Migration: `20251025211026_hourly_data_refresh.sql`

Updated all cron jobs to ensure hourly data refresh:

| Job Name | Schedule | Function | Purpose |
|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| `espn-scores-hourly` | Every hour at :05 | `invoke_fetch_espn_scores()` | Fetch ESPN scores |
| `betting-odds-hourly` | Every hour at :00 | `invoke_fetch_betting_odds()` | Fetch betting odds |
| `auto-monitor-bets-every-10min` | Every 10 minutes | `invoke_auto_monitor_bets()` | Settle bets |
| `daily-ai-predictions` | Daily at 6 AM ET | Edge function call | Generate predictions |

**Changes:**
- **Before:** Betting odds ran 5x per day at peak hours
- **After:** Betting odds run every hour
- **Before:** ESPN scores ran every 15 minutes (kept as-is but renamed)
- **After:** ESPN scores run every hour at :05 (to stagger with betting odds)

### 3. Updated Configuration

Added new function to `supabase/config.toml`:
```toml
[functions.fetch-sports-scores]
verify_jwt = false
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Link Supabase Project
```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref dskfsnbdgyjizoaafqfk
```

### Step 2: Set Required Secrets
```bash
# Set The Rundown API key (required for betting odds)
# Get your API key from RapidAPI: https://rapidapi.com/therundown/api/therundown
npx supabase secrets set THE_RUNDOWN_API=your-api-key-here
```

### Step 3: Deploy Edge Functions
```bash
# Deploy fetch-sports-scores
npx supabase functions deploy fetch-sports-scores

# Deploy fetch-betting-odds
npx supabase functions deploy fetch-betting-odds
```

Or use the automated script:
```bash
bash scripts/deploy-data-refresh.sh
```

### Step 4: Apply Database Migration
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

This will:
- Remove old cron jobs
- Create new hourly cron jobs
- Trigger immediate data refresh
- Set up monitoring views

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

Check cron job status:
```sql
SELECT * FROM data_refresh_cron_status;
```

Expected output:
```
jobname                         | schedule     | active
--------------------------------|--------------|-------
auto-monitor-bets-every-10min   | */10 * * * * | true
betting-odds-hourly             | 0 * * * *    | true
daily-ai-predictions            | 0 10 * * *   | true
espn-scores-hourly              | 5 * * * *    | true
```

Check ESPN data freshness:
```sql
SELECT * FROM espn_data_status;
```

Check betting odds freshness:
```sql
SELECT * FROM check_betting_odds_freshness('americanfootball_nfl', 60);
```

## Manual Data Refresh

If you need to trigger a manual data refresh:

### Fetch ESPN Scores Now
```sql
SELECT trigger_fetch_espn_scores();
```

### Fetch Betting Odds Now
```sql
SELECT trigger_fetch_betting_odds();
```

### Monitor Bets Now
```sql
SELECT trigger_auto_monitor();
```

## Monitoring & Logs

### Check ESPN Fetch Logs
```sql
SELECT * FROM espn_fetch_log
ORDER BY fetch_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Betting Odds Fetch Logs
```sql
SELECT * FROM betting_odds_fetch_log
ORDER BY fetch_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check All Cron Jobs
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job
ORDER BY jobname;
```

### Check Recent Cron Runs
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **ESPN Scores:** Updated every hour at :05 past the hour
2. **Betting Odds:** Updated every hour at the top of the hour
3. **Bet Settlement:** Runs every 10 minutes to quickly settle completed games
4. **Daily Predictions:** Generated once daily at 6:00 AM ET

**No more 20-hour data gaps!** ✅

## Testing the Fix

After deployment, wait 5 minutes and check:

```sql
-- Should show recent updates (within last hour)
SELECT
  league,
  COUNT(*) as games,
  MAX(last_updated) as last_updated,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now() - MAX(last_updated)))/60 as minutes_old
FROM sports_scores
WHERE event_id LIKE 'espn_%'
GROUP BY league
ORDER BY league;
```

Expected: `minutes_old` should be less than 60 for all leagues

## Troubleshooting

### No data being fetched?

1. **Check cron jobs are active:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM data_refresh_cron_status;
   ```
   All jobs should have `active = true`

2. **Check for errors in logs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM espn_fetch_log WHERE success = false;
   SELECT * FROM betting_odds_fetch_log WHERE success = false;
   ```

3. **Verify edge functions are deployed:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions list
   ```
   Should show `fetch-sports-scores` and `fetch-betting-odds`

4. **Check edge function logs:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions logs fetch-sports-scores
   npx supabase functions logs fetch-betting-odds
   ```

### Betting odds not updating?

**Most common issue:** `THE_RUNDOWN_API` not set

```bash
npx supabase secrets set THE_RUNDOWN_API=your-key
```

### ESPN scores not updating?

**Check ESPN API is accessible:**
```bash
curl "https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard"
```

Should return JSON with games.

## API Quota Management

### The Odds API
- **Free Tier:** 500 requests/month
- **Our Usage:** 24 requests/day × 30 days = 720 requests/month
- **⚠️ Warning:** Free tier won't be enough for hourly updates

**Recommendations:**
1. Upgrade to paid tier ($99/month for 5,000 requests)
2. Or reduce to 3x per day: 9 AM, 3 PM, 9 PM EST
3. Or fetch only during game days (implement smart scheduling)

### ESPN API
- **Free:** Unlimited requests
- **No API key needed**
- **Can run as frequently as needed**
