# API Integration Documentation

## Overview

BetGPT uses premium APIs to provide accurate, real-time sports betting data and analysis.

## Data Sources

- Live line movement data

**Implementation**: `supabase/functions/fetch-betting-odds/index.ts`

**API Endpoint**: The Rundown API via RapidAPI (`therundown-therundown-v1.p.rapidapi.com`)

**Cache Duration**: 30 minutes (configurable via cron job)

**API Key Required**: Yes - Set `THE_RUNDOWN_API` in Supabase edge function secrets

**Supported Sports**:
- NFL (`americanfootball_nfl`, sport_id: 2)
- NBA (`basketball_nba`, sport_id: 4)
- MLB (`baseball_mlb`, sport_id: 3)
- NHL (`icehockey_nhl`, sport_id: 1)
- Soccer/EPL (`soccer_epl`, sport_id: 6)

**Supported Bookmakers** (via affiliate_id):

```

### 2. OpenAI

  - Total yards, turnovers (football)
  - Shooting percentages (basketball)
  - Hits, runs, errors (baseball)
  - Shots on goal, power play stats (hockey)
- Key player performances
- Game context and trends

**Implementation**: `supabase/functions/fetch-openai-scores/index.ts`

**Cache Duration**: 2 hours (configurable)

**API Key Required**: Yes - Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in environment variables

**Model Used**: `gpt-4o` with JSON response format

**Usage**:
```typescript
// Automatically called when user asks about scores
// Examples: "What's the score of the Lakers game?"
//           "Show me NFL scores today"
//           "Who won the Yankees game?"
```

## Database Schema

- sport: TEXT
- league: TEXT
- home_team: TEXT
- away_team: TEXT
- home_score: INTEGER
- away_score: INTEGER
- game_status: TEXT
- game_date: TIMESTAMP
- last_updated: TIMESTAMP
- advanced_stats: JSONB (NEW - stores detailed statistics)
```

### betting_odds table
```sql

```

## Environment Variables Required

```bash

# Supabase (already configured)
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```

## Cache Strategy

### The Rundown API (Betting Odds)
- **Cache Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Reason**: Betting lines change frequently but API has rate limits
- **Strategy**: Check database first, fetch if stale
- **Smart Caching**:
  - Fresh (<5 min): Use immediately
  - Recent (5-30 min): Use with staleness note
  - Stale (>30 min): Trigger fresh fetch with timeout fallback

### OpenAI Scores
- **Cache Duration**: 2 hours
- **Reason**: Balance between real-time updates and API costs
- **Strategy**: Check database first, fetch if stale

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Accuracy**: Direct API access to authoritative sources
2. **Real-time Data**: Always current scores and odds
3. **Advanced Statistics**: Deep insights beyond basic scores
4. **Multiple Bookmakers**: Compare odds for best value
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Smart caching reduces API calls
6. **Scalability**: Can add more sports/markets easily

## API Cost Considerations

### The Rundown API (via RapidAPI)
- Pricing based on RapidAPI subscription tier
- Automated fetching: Every 30 minutes for active sports
- Estimated usage: ~720 requests/month (if all 5 sports active)
- Season-aware: Only fetches sports currently in season to minimize costs

### OpenAI API
- Pay per token usage
- GPT-4o costs: ~$2.50 per 1M input tokens
- Typical score fetch: ~500-1000 tokens
- Estimated cost: $0.001-0.003 per score fetch
