Users can rate AI responses with:
- **Thumbs up/down** - Quick helpful/not helpful feedback
- **Detailed feedback** - Optional text explaining what was good or could be improved
- **Star ratings** - Optional 1-5 star rating
- **Categories** - Accuracy, relevance, clarity, completeness, tone

**Use Cases:**
- Improve conversational AI responses
- Identify confusing or unhelpful explanations
- Track satisfaction by response type (betting advice, analysis, strategy)

### 2. Prediction Feedback
**Location:** Can be integrated into prediction displays, bet recommendations

Users can rate predictions with:
- **Helpful/Not Helpful** - Was this prediction useful?
- **Accurate/Inaccurate** - Did the prediction match the outcome?
- **Confidence Rating** (1-5 stars) - How confident were you in this prediction?
- **Value Rating** (1-5 stars) - How valuable was this to your decision?
- **User Action** - What did you do? (placed bet, skipped, saved for later, etc.)
- **Outcome Tracking** - Actual P/L if bet was placed

**Use Cases:**
- Track prediction accuracy over time
- Identify which sports/markets have best predictions
- Measure user engagement (conversion to actual bets)
- Calculate ROI from feedback-driven bets

### 3. Alert Feedback
**Location:** Can be integrated into notification displays, alert cards

Users can rate alerts with:
- **Useful/Not Useful** - Quick feedback on alert quality
- **Timely** - Was the alert received at the right time?

## Integration Guide

### Adding Message Feedback to Chat

The message feedback is already integrated into the chat interface. It appears automatically for assistant messages after streaming completes.

**How it works:**
1. ChatMessage component receives `messageId` and `conversationId` props
2. MessageFeedback component renders for assistant messages only
3. User hovers over message to see feedback buttons
4. Feedback is saved to database with unique constraint
5. "Feedback recorded" indicator shows after submission

### Adding Prediction Feedback to Predictions

To add prediction feedback to a prediction display:

```tsx
import { PredictionFeedback } from "@/components/PredictionFeedback";

// Inside your prediction card/component
<PredictionFeedback
  predictionId={prediction.id}
  gameId={prediction.game_id}
  sport={prediction.sport}
  predictionType={prediction.prediction_type}
  betId={associatedBetId} // If user placed bet
/>
```

### Adding Alert Feedback to Notifications

To add alert feedback to notification cards:

```tsx
import { AlertFeedback } from "@/components/AlertFeedback";

// Inside your notification card
<AlertFeedback
  notificationId={notification.id}
  alertType={notification.alert_type}
  priorityLevel={notification.priority_level}
  compact={false} // or true for inline display
/>
```

### Adding Feedback Dashboard to Settings

To display the feedback dashboard:

```tsx
import { FeedbackDashboard } from "@/components/FeedbackDashboard";

// Inside your settings or analytics page
<FeedbackDashboard />
```

## Usage Examples

### Fetching User Feedback Stats

```typescript
const { data: stats, error } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_user_feedback_stats', { p_user_id: userId });

console.log(`Total message feedback: ${stats.total_message_feedback}`);
console.log(`Positive messages: ${stats.positive_message_feedback}`);
console.log(`Helpful predictions: ${stats.helpful_predictions}`);
console.log(`Useful alerts: ${stats.useful_alerts}`);
console.log(`Avg satisfaction: ${stats.avg_satisfaction}`);
```

### Checking for Existing Feedback

```typescript
const { data: hasFeedback } = await supabase
  .rpc('has_message_feedback', {
    p_user_id: userId,
    p_message_id: messageId
  });

if (hasFeedback) {
  // User already provided feedback
}
```

### Querying Feedback Analytics

```typescript
const { data: analytics, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke(
  'feedback-analytics',
  {
    body: {
      type: 'overall',
      period: 'month'
    }
  }
);

console.log(`Overall satisfaction: ${analytics.summary.overallSatisfaction}%`);
console.log(`Message positive rate: ${analytics.message.positiveRate}%`);
console.log(`Prediction accuracy: ${analytics.prediction.accuracyRate}%`);
console.log(`Alert conversion: ${analytics.alert.conversionRate}%`);
```

## How the App Improves Over Time

### 1. Machine Learning Model Refinement

**Prediction Feedback Loop:**
- User provides feedback on prediction accuracy and helpfulness
- System tracks which predictions users act on (place bets)
- Outcome data (win/loss) linked back to predictions
- Model retraining uses feedback as additional signal
- Feature importance adjusted based on value ratings

**Result:** More accurate predictions for sports/markets with more feedback

### 2. Conversational AI Improvement

**Message Feedback Loop:**
- Positive/negative feedback on responses by type
- Category analysis (accuracy, clarity, relevance)
- Free-form text reveals specific issues
- Response patterns that get low ratings identified
- Prompts adjusted based on feedback trends

**Result:** Better explanations, more relevant advice, clearer communication

### 3. Alert Optimization

**Alert Feedback Loop:**
- Usefulness ratings identify valuable alert types
- False positive flags reduce noise
- Timeliness feedback optimizes trigger timing
- Conversion tracking shows which alerts drive action
- Relevance scores personalize per user

**Result:** Fewer false alerts, better timing, higher conversion rates

### 4. User Personalization

**Preference Learning:**
- User action patterns (placed bet vs skipped) inform preferences
- Confidence and value ratings reveal trust levels
- Sport/team preferences from feedback distribution
- Alert threshold tuning based on false positive rate
- Risk tolerance inferred from bet placement patterns

**Result:** Recommendations tailored to individual user preferences

### 5. Feature Prioritization

**Development Roadmap:**
- Feature feedback identifies bugs and friction points
- Satisfaction ratings guide improvement priorities
- Feature requests from users inform roadmap
- Ease-of-use scores highlight UX issues

**Result:** Development focused on highest-impact improvements

## Privacy & Security

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

All feedback tables have RLS enabled with policies ensuring:
- Users can only view their own feedback
- Users can only insert feedback for themselves
- Users can update their own feedback only
- Users can delete their own feedback

### Data Isolation

- All queries filtered by `auth.uid()` automatically
- No cross-user data leakage
- Aggregate analytics exclude identifying information

### Feedback Anonymization

For model training purposes:
- Feedback can be analyzed in aggregate
- Individual user data never used in training without consent
- Text feedback scrubbed of PII before analysis
